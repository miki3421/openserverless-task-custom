# Tasks `ops backup cluster`

Inspect and manage a local single-node K3s backup/restore rehearsal.

## Synopsis

```text
Usage:
  cluster plan [--json]
  cluster seed --run-id=<id> [--destination=<directory>]
  cluster verify-data --run-id=<id> [--destination=<directory>]
  cluster create --destination=<directory>
  cluster verify --backup=<directory>
  cluster delete --backup=<directory> --confirm-cluster-delete
  cluster restore --backup=<directory> --confirm-cluster-restore
```

## Commands

```text
plan    Read-only inventory of persistent volumes and supported backup paths.
seed    Write an identifiable synthetic marker to every local-path volume and a ConfigMap.
verify-data Check the marker ConfigMap and every persistent-volume marker.
create  Stop K3s briefly and create a compressed, offline archive.
verify  Check the archive checksum and required K3s state files.
delete  Remove the local K3s cluster only after verifying its archive.
restore Restore K3s state and local-path volumes from a verified archive.
```

The plan does not create backups or change cluster resources. It reports
whether the native local K3s archive path is supported, as well as Velero
readiness and coverage gaps. A successful plan is not proof of a completed
backup or restore.

## Options

```text
--json    Print machine-readable JSON.
```

`create`, `delete`, and `restore` support a single-node K3s server using the
SQLite datastore and PV data under `/var/lib/rancher/k3s`. The archive includes
the K3s database, token, configuration, binary, systemd unit, and local-path
volume data. `create` suspends CronJobs and scales workload controllers down
gracefully (operator controllers first), then stops K3s for the file snapshot.
It excludes the containerd runtime/image cache. Public images must be pulled
again after restore; private images must be pullable with the cluster's
registry credentials or imported from a separately saved image bundle while
the restore waits for workloads. `delete` requires a verified
archive and an explicit confirmation flag. `restore` requires the cluster to
have been deleted, checks the archive again, reinstalls its saved state, and
waits for the node to become Ready.

Keep the archive outside `/var/lib/rancher/k3s`; K3s uninstall removes that
directory. A directory on the same VM survives the cluster deletion and is
suitable for this lab rehearsal, but is not an off-host disaster-recovery copy.
The task refuses multi-node/etcd clusters and PVs outside the K3s data tree.
It does not provide application-level consistency for external volumes or
replace database-native backup policies.

`seed` and `verify-data` provide repeatable, non-secret test markers for all
bound local-path PVs and a ConfigMap listing the OPS component families. Use a
unique run ID; the marker files are placed at the root of each PV and are not
application-native database records.
